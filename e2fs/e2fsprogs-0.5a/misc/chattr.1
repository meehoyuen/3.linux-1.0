.SH DESCRIPTION

existing attributes of the files; `-' causes them to be removed; and
`=' causes them to be the only attributes that the files have.

updates (S), compressed (c), secure deletion (s), and undeletable (u).

.SH AUTHOR
.B chattr
has been written by Remy Card <card@masi.ibp.fr>, the developer and maintainer
of the ext2 fs.
.SH BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
As of ext2 fs 0.4, the kernel code only honours the `s' and `S' attributes. When
a file with the `s' attribute set is deleted, its blocks are zeroed and
written back to the disk. When a file with the `S' attribute set is modified,
the changes are written synchronously on the disk; this is equivalent to
the `sync' mount option applied to a subset of the files.
.PP
The other attributes will be implemented in a next ext2 fs version.
.SH AVAILABILITY
.B chattr
is available for anonymous ftp from ftp.ibp.fr (132.227.60.2) in
