.SH DESCRIPTION
.B e2fsck
is used to check a Linux second extended file system.
.TP
.I device
is the special file corresponding to the device (e.g /dev/hdXX).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I -b superblock
Instead of using the normal superblock, use the alternative superblock
specified by 
.IR superblock .
.TP
.I -d
Print debugging output (useless unless you are debugging
.B e2fsck
).
.TP
.I -f
Force checking even if the file system seems clean.
.TP
.I -F
Flush the filesystem device's buffer caches before beginning.  Only
really useful for doing e2fsck time trials.
.TP
.I -l filename
Add the blocks listed in the file specified by 
.I filename
to the list of bad blocks.
.TP
.I -L filename
Set the bad blocks list to be the list of blocks specified by 
.IR filename .
(This option is the same as the 
.I -l
option, except the bad blocks list is cleared before the blocks listed
in the file are added to the bad blocks list.)
.TP
.I -n
Open the filesystem read-only, and assume an answer of ``no'' to all
questions.  Allows
.B e2fsck
to be used non-interactively.  (Note: if the 
.I -l
or
.I -L
options are specified in addition to the 
.I -n
option, then the filesystem will be opened read-write, to permit the
bad-blocks list to be updated.  However, no other changes will be made
to the filesystem.)
.TP
.I -p
Automatically repair ("preen") the file system without any questions.
The
.I -a
option is provided for backwards compatibility.
.TP
.I -t
Print timing statistics for
.BR e2fsck .
If this option is used twice, additional timing statistics are printed
on a pass by pass basis.
.TP
.I -v
Verbose mode.
.TP
.I -V
Print version information and exit.
.TP
.I -y
Assume an answer of ``yes'' to all questions; allows 
.B e2fsck
to be used non-interactively.
.SH EXIT CODE
The exit code returned by
.B e2fsck
is the sum of the following conditions:
.br
\	0\	\-\ No errors
.br
\	1\	\-\ File system errors corrected
.br
\	2\	\-\ File system errors corrected, system should
.br
\	\	\ \ be rebooted if file system was mounted
.br
\	4\	\-\ File system errors left uncorrected
.br
\	8\	\-\ Operational error
.br
\	16\	\-\ Usage or syntax error
.br
\	128\	\-\ Shared library error
