	To install the second extended file system management program,
just follow the steps:

1) Edit the file MCONFIG

	This file contains definitions used in the various makefiles.  These
definitions have reasonable default value but you may want to adjust them to 
your system configuration.

2) Create the dependencies files

	Run `make depend' to create the dependencies files.  Note that this
is not strictly necessary since the makefiles automagically recreates them
if they do not exist.

3) Compile the programs

	Run `make' to compile the libraries and the programs.

4) Install the programs

	Run `make install'

5) Install the include files and libraries

	You can run `make install-libs' to install the include files and
libraries.  Please note that this installation is not needed for the
programs to work.  It is only needed if you expect to develop other
programs using the libraries.


	You can run `make world' as an alternative to steps 2 and 3.  This
will create the dependencies files, compile the programs and run e2fsck on
a test suite contained in e2fsck/images.
